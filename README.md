# 🎙️ Welcome to Jukshio's ClearSpeech\!

Hi there\! This is a super handy tool designed to make your life easier. It takes your audio recordings, writes down exactly what was said (transcription), and then translates it into English for you.

It's like having a personal translator right on your computer\!

<!-- ## 🛠️ How to Get Started

Before you run the app, you just need to make sure you have a few helper tools installed.

1.  **Get the code:** Save the python code as `app.py`.
2.  **Install the tools:** Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run this one simple command:


```bash
pip install streamlit requests mutagen
```

3.  **Run the app:** Now, type this command to start the magic:


```bash
streamlit run app.py
``` -->

## 🚀 How to Use It

Once the app opens in your browser, just follow these steps:

1.  **Upload Audio:** Drag and drop your audio file (we support `.mp3`, `.wav`, or `.m4a`).
2.  **Pick your Settings:**
      * Type in the language code of your audio (like `hi` for Hindi).
      * Choose which "Brain" (Model) you want to use. You can pick the **Fast** one or the **Standard** one.
3.  **Hit Go:** Click the big **Start Processing** button.
4.  **Download:** Once it's done, you can see the text side-by-side and download a neat little report to share with others.

## 💡 A Few Helpful Tips

  * **Keep it Short:** For the best results, try to keep your audio files under **5 minutes**.
  * **Audio Length:** The app will automatically calculate how long your audio is when you upload it.
  * **Trouble?** If you see a red error box, the app will usually give you a hint on what to do (like checking your internet or the server status).
